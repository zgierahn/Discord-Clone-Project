# Discords Project

This was a group project where we decided to make a clone of the popular Discord website. You can view our site live: [Discords](https://group-clone.onrender.com).
Discords is a real time communication site with different chat communities called "Servers", with individual chatrooms within the Servers, called "Channels." 
We have made it possible to sign up and create a user, join servers, and chat live in different Channels all while styled like the original Discord website.
